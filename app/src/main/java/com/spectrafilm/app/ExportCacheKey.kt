/*
 * Spektrafilm for Android — content-addressed export cache key (issue #179). GPLv3.
 * Film modeling powered by spektrafilm.
 *
 * The key must cover EVERY input that can change an exported byte. An incomplete key does not
 * fail loudly: it serves a stale image that looks plausible, which is the same silent-wrong-output
 * class of defect as the R8 keep-rule bug and the benchmark's hard-coded grade constant. So the
 * rule here is that nothing is assumed to be irrelevant, and `ExportCacheKeyTest` re-derives the
 * covered set independently.
 *
 * What goes in, and why each part is load-bearing:
 *   * the SOURCE IMAGE CONTENT, digested — not the URI. Photo-picker URIs are ephemeral (see
 *     Recipes.keyFor), so a URI key both misses on a re-picked file and, far worse, can HIT when
 *     a reused content URI now points at different bytes.
 *   * every engine parameter, via SpektraParams.toString(). That tree is pure data classes with
 *     no array fields (the property GradeCache.Key already depends on), so its toString is a
 *     complete, deterministic rendering of every field, and a new engine parameter joins the key
 *     the day it is added rather than the day someone remembers to update this file.
 *   * the post-engine grade and mask edits, which the engine parameters deliberately exclude.
 *   * the full OutputDescriptor. Its own toString prints only 5 of its 16 fields, so the fields
 *     are enumerated here; equals/hashCode cover all 16 but a 32-bit hash is not a safe key.
 *   * the output geometry and JPEG quality, which live outside the descriptor.
 *   * the EXIF GPS policy (Settings > keep GPS). It decides which source tags reach the container
 *     and nothing else in the key saw it, so an export with GPS turned off could republish the
 *     cached file that still carried the coordinates (#225).
 *   * a contract version covering the app build. Profiles, spectral LUTs and ICC assets ship
 *     inside the APK and cannot change without it, so one version string covers all of them
 *     along with the engine binary and the numeric contract.
