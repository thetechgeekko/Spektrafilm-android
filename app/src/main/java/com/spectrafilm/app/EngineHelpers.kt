 *     (spektra.cpp ~L265-267); the input is never written.
 *   - `spk_simulate_preview` downscales `in->data` into a fresh `std::vector<float> small`
 *     (read-only read; spektra.cpp ~L901) before simulating.
 *   - The JNI obtains `in_data` via `GetDirectBufferAddress` and only reads it (spektra_jni.cpp).
 * Therefore re-using the cached buffer cannot corrupt it. (If the engine ever started writing

 * eligible for GC — we never hold two large source buffers at once.
 *
 * Thread-safety: all access happens from the preview render coroutine (Dispatchers.Default /
 * .IO sequentially per render); methods are `@Synchronized` as cheap insurance since
