/**
 * Keeps a running export alive when the user leaves the app.
 *
 * ## Why this exists: kill-resistance, NOT speed
 *
 * A long backgrounded export is a kill candidate for Samsung's device-health
 * manager (`com.sec.android.sdhms`). Measured on SM-S948W, this service is what
 * stops that:
 *
 * ```
 *   with the service running:  oom_score_adj =  50
 *   after it stops:            oom_score_adj = 700
 * ```
 *
 * That is the whole of its value, and it is real — it is the fix for #153.
 *
 * ## It does NOT fix the 4x background slowdown. Measured, not assumed.
 *
 * This service was written believing it would. It does not, and the device run
 * that proved it also explained why. Backgrounding still costs ~3.9x (backgrounded
 * median 55063 ms vs foreground 14102 ms over 7 runs) even though the service
 * starts every single time and the notification posts every single time.
 *
 * The cpuset is the mechanism, and it predicts the result exactly — but a
 * foreground service does not determine which cpuset the process lands in:
 *
 * ```
 *   cpu0-5  max 3.63 GHz        cpu6-7  max 4.74 GHz   (prime pair)
 *
 *   /top-app          cpus=0-7      <- 14214 ms   foreground
 *   /foreground-boost cpus=0-7      <- 14927 ms   transient interaction boost
 *   /foreground       cpus=0-5      <- no prime cores; best an FGS normally rates
 *   /moderate         cpus=0-1,4-5  <- 55357 ms   where backgrounded exports land
 *   /background       cpus=0-1,4-5  <- identical mask to /moderate
 * ```
 *
 * `/moderate` is byte-identical to `/background` in CPU terms: half the cores and
 * zero prime cores. **No service-tier cpuset on this device contains cpu6/7**, so
 * changing `foregroundServiceType` cannot rescue it either. The perf half of #153
 * is not solvable with a foreground service on this hardware.
 *
 * The 4x is also only ever paid while the user leaves the app — the foreground
 * path was never slow. The remaining honest lever is the ~14 s foreground export.
 *
 * ## Ownership split
 *
 * It runs no rendering code of its own. [ExportWorkRuntime]'s process-owned coroutine
 * owns the export across Activity recreation; this service only holds the process's
 * lifecycle/scheduling class while that work runs. The service therefore remains off
 * the render path and carries no image-parity risk.
 *
 * Every failure path is swallowed: an export that would have succeeded slowly must
 * never fail because a notification channel or an OEM background-start rule said no.
