/**
 * Process-scoped owner of the single native [SpektraEngine].
 *
 * The engine is immutable after construction — it only holds read-only bundled
 * profiles + LUTs, and its `simulate` path has no shared mutable state — so one
 * instance is reused for the whole process across Activity recreations
 * (configuration changes, returning from background, etc.).
 *
 * This fixes a native-memory leak: the editor used to create a fresh engine in a
 * `LaunchedEffect(Unit)` on every recomposition-from-scratch (e.g. every rotation)
 * and never destroyed the previous one, orphaning its ~17 MB-class native state
 * each time.
 *
 * We deliberately never [SpektraEngine.close] the shared engine during the app's
 * life. The only safe moment to release the native handle is process death, which
 * the OS handles for us — closing on composition dispose would race a render
 * coroutine still executing inside `nativeSimulate` and free the handle out from
 * under it (use-after-free). A single immutable engine per process avoids both the
 * leak and that race.
