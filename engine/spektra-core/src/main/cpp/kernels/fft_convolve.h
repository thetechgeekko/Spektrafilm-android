 *
 * Computes EXACTLY the operator model/diffusion.cpp's direct loop computes:
 *
 *     out[y][x] = sum_{i,j in [0,ks)} padded[y+i][x+j] * kern[ks-1-i][ks-1-j]
 *
 * in O(n log n) instead of O(w*h*ks^2). Not an approximation and not a different
 * filter — the same sum, reassociated. See the derivation in fft_convolve.cpp.
 *
 * WHY: that direct loop is quadratic in pixel count because the kernel radius
 * scales with image width, which costs 30.7 s for one 640px preview and an
 * extrapolated 10.9 hours for a 12 MP export at the app's default Black Pro-Mist
 * settings (#160, docs/research/perf-lab.md 20).
 *
 * NOT BIT-IDENTICAL to the direct loop, and cannot be. Reassociating a sum in
 * floating point changes the last bits; measured drift is ~1e-16 relative, which
 * is twelve orders inside the 1e-4 parity bar, but it is not zero. Callers hold
 * this to a TOLERANCE, never to byte-equality against the direct path.
 *
 * IS deterministic across worker counts: every transform is independent and
 * writes only its own row/column/tile, there is no reduction across threads, and
 * kernels/fft.h fixes the butterfly order. Byte-identical for any thread count is
 * preserved; only equality with the *direct* path is given up.

// Default cap on the square transform size. Scratch is two interleaved-complex
// f64 spectra of N x (N/2+1) plus one N x N real plane:
//
//     2 * N*(N/2+1)*2*8  +  N*N*8   bytes
//
// = 100.7 MB at N = 2048 and 402.8 MB at N = 4096 (it grows 4x per doubling).
// An earlier revision of this comment quoted 134 / 537 MB; that was the formula
// from BEFORE the real-to-complex change, which dropped the spectra from N x N
// to N x (N/2+1) columns. Measure from the assign() calls in fft_convolve_same,
// not from this comment.
//
// This is a CEILING, not the size that gets used: fft_convolve_transform_size
// picks the cheapest admissible transform below it, because the largest one is
// often the slowest (a 12 MP Pro-Mist kernel wants N = 4096 and is 5.0x faster
// there than at 2048, while a 1536 px one is 2x SLOWER at 4096 than at 1024).
// The ceiling exists only to bound scratch: 67.1 MB at N = 2048, 268.4 MB at
// N = 4096, 1.07 GB at N = 8192, growing 4x per doubling.
//
// This used to say 8192 was unaffordable at 1.5 GB and "measured slower than
// 4096 anyway". BOTH halves of that are now wrong, and a real user export is
// what showed it:
//
//   fft=n4096/ks3059/convs3/clamped0     12.5 MP, Black Pro-Mist, 12572 ms
//
// The kernel is ks = 3059, not the ks ~ 1725 the old note was measured at. At
// 4096 the usable block is 1038 px, so a 12.5 MP frame needs 12 tiles; at 8192
// it needs ONE. Measured at that geometry, 4096: 5652 ms (12 tiles) against
// 8192: 3956 ms (1 tile) -- 1.43x the other way. "8192 is slower" held only
// for the mid-size kernels it was measured on, where 8192 buys one tile that
// was already four.
//
// And the 1.5 GB figure predated dropping the real n x n plane: the scratch is
// two spectra now, so 8192 is 1.07 GB.
//
// Raising the ceiling is fail-safe rather than a gamble: model/diffusion.cpp's
// reserve_fft_scratch already walks the ceiling DOWN until the process memory
// budget admits a size, so a device that cannot afford 8192 gets exactly the
// 4096 it gets today. The ceiling admits a candidate; it never forces one.
//
// Callers that must not risk that much scratch pass a smaller max_transform --
// model/diffusion.cpp clamps this by the process memory budget's own headroom,
// so a big transform can never turn a completing export into an OOM.
//
// READ THIS FIRST if you are tempted to raise it: scratch allocation failure is
// a controlled std::bad_alloc denial. It must propagate to the render boundary;
// callers must never replace it with the DIRECT O(w*h*ks^2) loop, which for
// Black Pro-Mist at 12 MP is the ~10.9-hour path this file exists to remove.
