 *
 * A minimal fork-join helper for the engine's embarrassingly-parallel maps:
 * the per-pixel stages (expose / scan / print_expose), the DIR-coupler and
 * density-curve interpolations, the spatial kernels (Gaussian/exponential
 * filters, diffusion convolution — parallel_for_weighted below), the 3D-LUT
 * apply, and the element-wise mix/copy passes around them. The range
 * [begin, end) is split into contiguous, disjoint chunks whose boundaries
 * depend ONLY on (count, threads) — never on thread scheduling. Because each
 * item is computed independently and written to a disjoint output location,
 * the result is BIT-IDENTICAL to the serial loop for any thread count, which
 * preserves the bit-exact parity gate.
 *
 * Stochastic grain does NOT use parallel_for: model/grain.cpp runs its own
 * fixed-block scheme (deterministic per-block seeding + a dynamic
 * atomic-counter worker pool) so the seeded RNG stays reproducible per block
 * regardless of which worker runs it — gated by test_parallel scenario 5.
