#
# What it answers, in order:
#   1. f64 Highway lanes on the HALATION tier  — the default-ON spatial path the
#      earlier f32-only round never touched. A/B by SPK_SIMD, with an end-to-end
#      checksum compared across the two processes so "faster" is also "identical".
#   2. big.LITTLE affinity — is the render pool being parked on efficiency cores?
#      Sweeps SPK_BIG_CORE_RATIO so the cluster split is measured, not assumed.
#   3. The three parity-affecting levers (perf_lab.cpp): batched/GEMM-shaped
#      spectral integral, Gaussian-mixture diffusion PSF, fp16/f32 plane storage.
#      Each prints a speedup AND a deviation from the exact path.
#
# Env:
#   ANDROID_NDK_HOME  NDK r28c root (auto-detected under $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/ndk)
set -uo pipefail
# NOT -e. A failing correctness test is exactly when the later sections matter
# most -- the device run that found the f64 problem lost the affinity sweep and
# every lever to a single non-zero exit. Failures are reported and the script
# carries on; the final summary says what failed.
