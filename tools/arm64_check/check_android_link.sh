# Spektrafilm for Android — link the engine the way the ANDROID build does. GPLv3.
# Port of spektrafilm (GPLv3) by Andrea Volpato — film modeling powered by spektrafilm.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# CI has broken twice from the same root cause: a change verified in an
# environment better equipped than CI. The specific trap is documented in
# CLAUDE.md — the HOST parity build compiles with a glob
# (`kernels/*.cpp model/*.cpp ...`) while the ANDROID build enumerates every
# source in CMakeLists.txt by hand. A new .cpp that is missing from CMakeLists
# therefore passes all 39 host gates and fails only at the Android `ninja`
# step, as an undefined reference. Commit 551c57f cost a red CI run exactly
# that way.
#
# The host suite also never compiles spektra_jni.cpp at all (it is `#ifdef
# __ANDROID__` territory), so a JNI-side mistake is invisible to it too.
#
# This script closes both holes without a device and without gradle: it links
# libspektra.so for arm64 with the real NDK clang, the real shipping flags, the
# CMakeLists source list, `-Wl,--no-undefined`, and the project's 16 KB page
# flag — then checks the LOAD alignment CI gates.
#
