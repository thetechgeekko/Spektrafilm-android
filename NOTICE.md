## Film modeling powered by spektrafilm

The film-simulation engine in this project is a port of **spektrafilm** by Andrea Volpato.

- Upstream: https://github.com/andreavolpato/spektrafilm
- License: GPLv3
- Citation: see `CITATION.cff` upstream / the project's Zenodo DOI.

Per the upstream request: *film modeling powered by `spektrafilm`*. Any academic use should
cite the upstream repository.

## Vulkan orchestration reference: spektrafilm OFX

Selected Vulkan host and resource-lifetime orchestration is adapted from
**spektrafilm OFX** by Aedan Oskar Otto Diez.

- Upstream: https://github.com/chaert-s/spektrafilm-ofx
- Pinned source: `86476afc5b077de77e2278e3658d1ba9309892a1`
- License: GPL-3.0-only
- Adaptation record: `docs/research/spektrafilm-ofx-port.md`
- Shader code adapted (modified copy, GPL-3.0-only, both copyright lines kept):
  `shaders/vulkan/SpektraHalation.comp` -> `engine/spektra-core/src/main/cpp/gpu/halation_scatter.comp`

This Android project is independent and is not endorsed by the upstream author. No official
binary-only resources or spektrafilm OFX-exported LUTs are included.

## Color science: colour-science

Color-matching functions, illuminants, chromatic adaptation, and color-space transforms follow
**colour-science** — the reference used by spektrafilm and the ground truth for this port.

- Upstream: https://www.colour-science.org / https://github.com/colour-science/colour
- License: BSD-3-Clause

## Android architecture reference: Image Toolbox

The Android app design is informed by **Image Toolbox** by T8RIN (Malik Mukhametzyanov) — its
modular Compose/Hilt architecture guided this project, and it remains the intended richer host
for future versions.

- Upstream: https://github.com/T8RIN/ImageToolbox
- License: Apache License 2.0 (one-way compatible with GPLv3)

## RAW decoding: LibRaw

<!-- libraw-license-route: UNRESOLVED -->

LibRaw Android distribution route: UNRESOLVED.

Full-resolution RAW/DNG decoding uses **LibRaw**.

- Upstream: https://www.libraw.org / https://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw
- License: LibRaw is offered under a choice of LGPL-2.1-only or CDDL-1.0. No
  distribution route has been selected for this application's static integration;
  including both upstream license texts records provenance and does not elect a
  route. CDDL-1.0 is not generally treated as GPL-compatible. Release remains
  blocked on the human review and reproducible source/relink package described in
  `docs/LICENSING.md`. The route marker cannot be changed alone: the canonical
  decision record must also identify the human approval and confirm rights to
  license the local patch contributions under the selected route.

## Film & paper profiles

The 28 film/paper JSON profiles and the spectral-upsampling LUT binaries originate from
the spektrafilm project and are redistributed under GPLv3. See `docs/ASSETS.md`.

## ICC color profiles

The bundled ICC profiles under `engine/spektra-core/src/main/assets/spektra/icc/` are
redistributed from two upstream sets (carried over from spektrafilm's asset bundle) so the
export writers can embed a correct color interpretation. They are kept under their original
upstream filenames for traceability. See `engine/spektra-core/src/main/assets/spektra/icc/README.md`.
